                                    This website was a fairly simple process, however despite how simple it is I covered a lot of fundamentals throughout the process.
                                    Basic web development skills (HTML/CSS/JS), github/git, and deployment with cloudflare were a few important thing I picked up over this project.
                                    While going into this I knew a fair amount about HTML/CSS, ive never deployed a site before, and learning things like github and cloudflare were intially pretty daunting, but turned out a lot easier than i thought
                                </p>
                                <h3>
                                    Design
                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                    in making the website, there were a few important steps that i had to plan out.
                                    the first and most obvious was website design;
                                    for this website i decided id go with a template, but before i chose a template i decided that i wanted one with a more minimalist aesthetic, which is what i ended up searching for and is the main design philosophy behind this site.
                                    as a result ive tried to make the site simple and intuitive, trying to avoid the obnoxious headers which are pretty widespread across much of the internet now.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    after choosing a template i was happy with, i then planned out a general structure for my website.
                                    i wanted to split the website into a couple different categories: art, engineering, my bio, and links to friends websites.
                                    within each category it would branch into different pages, for example art has portraits, pieces, etc and each leads to the different pieces.
                                    its a very easy way not only organizationally, but also navigationally on the user end
                                </p>
                                <h3>
                                    Deployment
                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                    up till now ive never had any experience deploying a website, which is why i was excited for this to be my first
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    in doing this i had to learn my way around github and cloudflare on a basic level, which was cool because ive seen so many other people with skills in these areas.
                                    the deployment itself really wasnt too bad.
                                    with github i just made a repository for the website and learned how to stage, commit, and push everything onto the repo.
                                    from there i bought a domain with cloudflare and connected it to my github, and now the site was live!
                                    this is one of the few times im glad to have a pretty obscure last name, since the domain was available and dumb cheap at that.
                                </p>
                                <h3>
                                    Features
                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                    some cool features id like to highlight are the gallery pages, which have a lot of my artwork on there.
                                    another one is whenever you hover over pictures, and see a preview of what will be on the page. i think it makes for a very streamlined user experience.
                                    theres also the sidebar, which has links to my linked and discord, which ill probably change to github by the time this is up
                                </p>
                                <h3>
                                    Challenges/Reflection
                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                    imma jump ahead here but after deploying my website i showed my sister, since i wanted to show her some of my art which i dont think she had seen before.
                                    i noticed that she was on mobile, which isnt something i had tested on.
                                    some of the features were a bit janky which is something that i really shouldve had in mind while coding the site.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    when deploying my site i also had some issues with site security, since my site wasnt secured, but luckily i figured that out pretty quick, so it wasnt too much of a hassle
                                    thers a bunch of other small things on my to-do list, which ill have done at some point in the future.
                                    im not gonna release patch notes for the site (just check the commit m's), but heres a list of some things i still need to do:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>switch discord to github logo</li>
                                        <li>fix overlay issue on images (too dark)</li>
                                        <li>add highlight sections to some pages</li>
                                        <li>fix the buttons on the photos</li>
                                        <li>add articles for unfinished pages (e.g. beaver bot)</li>
                                        <li>add potpourri page and add content for it</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
