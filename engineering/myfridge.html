                            <h2>Overview</h2>
                            <div>
                                <p>myfridge is a recipe generator and pantry tracker powered by chatgpt. you can input indgredients and quantities of them in a list which is tracked. you can also alter and delete ingredients from the list. one of the cooler functionalities is the ability to generate recipes based on the ingredients present</p>
                            </div>

                            <h2>Development</h2>
                            <div>
                                <p>This project was built mainly using next.js and was also my first time using it. most of the local functionality (adding, deleting, changing list) was done with nextjs and material ui to make things look nicer. also the list of ingredients was stored on firebase. the generated ingredients was done through openai api routes through javascript, and integrated in the style of my personal website. unlike this website it was deployed with vercel with continuous integration in mind</p>
                            </div>

                            <h2>Reflection</h2>
                            <div>
                                <p>this was a pretty calm project, and i remember trying to cram it in the middle of my internship and summer classes. honestly im not really a fan of all the javascript that was involved with this, along with the routing things since i dont really fuck with web development, but i think part of that is due to the fact that i havent worked too much with javascript</p>
