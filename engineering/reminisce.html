                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <div>
                            <p>reminisce was our group's project for Hack Rutgers 2024. its an app meant for those with alzheimers to help them remember their daily activies. it tracks user location and photos and helps build a timeline of their day to day activies, to help prevent memory loss. this was my first solo hackathon where i didnt know anyone, so i was pretty nervous going into this. luckily i found a team of people just looking to have fun and not do anything too serious and we were able to put this together.</p>

                        <h2>Development</h2>
                        <div>
                            <p>to start we used figma to create mockups of the app and how it would function. once we got an understanding of what we wanted out of the app we began development. we split it into ui/ux (frontend) and database and api routing (backend). for the ui we used react native which also helped with location data, and we used mongodb to store info about users, location, and metadata from photos. we linked the database together with javascript and ngrok for api routes and sent it all back to the main application</p>

                        <h2>Reflection</h2>
                        <div>
                            <p>i had a lot of fun at this event despite literally knowing nobody at rutgers and im glad i was able to make a bunch of friends there. its definitely encouraging so i hope to run another solo hackathon sometime in the future. while it was great, sleeping on couches n downing pizza, i think management was a bit all over the place, and learning how to better coordinate people is an area i could work on from this event. learning how to PM is definitely a skill i wanna spec into since if im ever gonna make a startup i better know how to manage people. also during the presentations, i should have stepped in a bit more which would have balanced out the presentations a bit</p>
                            <p>i remember the ice cream being hella good (the lychee ice cream was gas asf). shoutout to my teammates Jeffrey, Angelina (i better see u at NYU hacks), and Ali. i think half of us barely knew how to code but we still pulled this together so thats a W</p>
                            <p>also shoutout to the extended team Johnathan, Akshit, and Saloni. if only we could have built an 8-person superteam T^T</p>
                            <p>also the project isnt called reminisce but i made a cool graphic for it so imma run with it</p>
