							hi, im riley.
							im a current sophomore at bmcc majoring in engineering, hoping to go into computer engineering and more specifically robotics.
							i do a lot of cs/datasci/ai stuff as well, and i like to explore a lot of areas, especially related to engineering and my field, robotics.
							aside from that i also enjoy making art, as it satiates my need to just create, and i like to experiment a lot with that kind of stuff.
							i hope to make robots to take everyones jobs someday so that we can focus on better things besides flipping burgers and washing dishes.

                            hi, im riley Drcelik.
                            im currently a sophomore in bmcc's engineering sci program, and i plan to pursue computer engineering upon transfering.
                            in that realm, i also enjoy learning about cs and data sci, as those things are very much interconnected with engineering at this point.
                            to me, being able to combine all these aspects of these dispiplines is what makes for a complete design and you just cant have one without the Other.
                            ultamitely i wanna do something really cool with ai, like i imagine my appartment where the dishes are fully automated, my breakfast is made by a robot chef, and when i walk into the room the lights turn on by themselves.
                            learning about how all this hardware interacts with the software is the only way to do these things, which is my main motivation.
                            basically im tryna make my life as automated as possible, which is what robots were supposed to do, not boost videos for the algorithm or police our streets.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            other than the engineering stuff i first learned to love making things in the 2d space, with a pencil and paper.
                            as a kid i really wanted to be an artist, which evolved into a mangaka as i grew into middle school.
                            getting rejected from art school though, my motivations shifted. i didnt start a dictatorship but i did get more into stem and specifically cs before finding a lot of interest in robotics.
                            while its not my main focus i still very much enjoy drawing all kinds of things.
                            when im in class i like to just doodle more abstract things, or anime type drawings.
                            out of class though portraits are just my favorite, to me its a lot of fun to find a really beautiful looking person and recreate that picture on my screen.
                            but this kinda evolved out of a desire to get better at drawing in the anime style. 
                            its something that influenced me heavily, and you can see my anime list to see which titles impacted me the most.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I would have a list for music as well but i listen to so much and my playlist is updated nearly daily so it would be impossible to reasonably keep up
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            kinda shifting to more of a factual biography (oh boy rip all my info the AI's are gonna have it all), i was born and have lived in brooklyn my whole life.
                            i really wanna see what else is around and i like to go around and exlpore different parts of the world.
                            its really fun to learn about different cultures and live somewhere completely different, its a nice novelty and its something i hope i get the chance to explore when i transfer colleges.
                            outside of ny i haven't really been to many places. i frequent PA (philly) occasionally and ive been to portland and FL as the farthest parts of the US.
                            outside of the US ive been to Canada and Hong Kong.
                            i really enjoyed hong kong, it felt like an alternative nyc and i hope someday to visit again.
                            on that note im half chinese, which a lot of people dont immediately assume since i dont look very east asian.
                            you can guess which side is the asian side.
                            i went to elementary through high school in brooklyn, and currently i go to college in manhattan.
                            i wont say much about my elementary and middle school years but in high school i originally went to fort hamilton before transferring into tech.
                            overall i liked tech a lot better than fort hamilton, although fort hamilton by far had better teachers.
                            i majored in mechatronics & robotics at tech and it really sparked my love for engineering, which carries on through college.
                            while i wasnt the best student, my time here was still valueable and there were a lot of things i learned which come in handy despite not showing up on a paper.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            now in college i think i've changed a lot for the better. life is moving pretty fast, and its very exciting.
                            i look forward to seeing what else is out there.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            also i really like urbexing and hiking so hmu for that stuff im 100% down
